# Project Astra (Autonomous AI Productivity Manager)
**Dates:** Ongoing
**Skills:** Architecture, Memory Systems, Security, Scheduling

Built a unified agent framework using Google's Agent Development Kit and Python (Asyncio), featuring a multi-tier architecture (Discord bot → Session Manager → Agent Executor).
- Architecture: Built a unified agent framework using Google's Agent Development Kit and Python (Asyncio), featuring a multi-tier architecture (Discord bot → Session Manager → Agent Executor).
- Memory Systems: Implemented a long-term memory system using Neo4j knowledge graphs and Graphiti, creating a dual-database system (SQLite + Neo4j) for semantic and operational data.
- Security: Engineered a defense-in-depth sandbox environment with AST-based validation, import blacklisting, and resource limits to safely execute autonomous Python code.
- Scheduling: Developed a sophisticated background job scheduler supporting complex recurrence patterns (Cron, natural language intervals) and pre-execution validation.
